Repositories
------------

For Debian/Ubuntu systems include this line in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/logentries.list`:

	deb http://rep.logentries.com/ XXX main

Replace `XXX` with the name of your system, i.e. one of wheezy, jessie,
lucid, precise, quantal, saucy, trusty, utopic, vivid. You also need to add
Logentries release key:

	gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys C43C79AD && gpg -a --export C43C79AD | apt-key add -

(Keyservers are not always reliable. In automated scripts do the following.)

	(gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys C43C79AD \
	|| gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C43C79AD) \
	&& gpg -a --export C43C79AD | apt-key add -

Then run `apt-get update` and `apt-get install logentries`. If you want to run
the agent as daemon, install it via `apt-get install logentries-daemon`.

For rpm-based systems RH, CentOS, Fedora, add this in `/etc/yum.repos.d/logentries.repo`

	[logentries]
	name=Logentries repo
	enabled=1
	metadata_expire=1d
	baseurl=http://rep.logentries.com/XXX/\$basearch
	gpgkey=http://rep.logentries.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-logentries

Replace `XXX` with the name of your system, i.e. one of fedora18, fedora19,
fedora20, fedora21, rh5, rh6, amazonlatest, centos5, centos6. Then run `yum
update` and `yum install logentries`. If you want to run the agent as daemon,
install it via `yum install logentries-daemon`.


Configuration file
------------------

The agent stores configuration in `~/.le/config` for ordinary users and in
`/etc/le/config` for root (daemon). It is created with `init` or `reinit`
commands and can be created or modified manually.

The structure of the configuration file follows standard similar to what you
find in `.git/config` or Windows INI files. For example:

	[Main]
	user-key = e720a1e8-a7d5-4f8b-8879-854e51c9290d
	agent-key = 428b888a-29ab-4079-99ec-9cb7aa2ffea7

	[cassandra]
	metrics-process = org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon
	path = /var/log/cassandra/system.log
	token = a846bd59-a674-4088-b9fd-e72da1df5946

Main section `[Main]` contains agent-wide general configuration. Any other
section defines per-application settings such as log filenames and metrics.

In the main section, `user-key` (account key) which identifies account, and
`agent-key` which identifies host (host key).

Note the `monitor` command requires both `user-key` and `agent-key` defined.


Follow log files through server-side configuration
--------------------------------------------------

After registering the host (via `register` command or specifying `agent-key` in
configuration) you can add a file to follow via `follow` command:

	sudo le follow /srv/log/cassandra/system.out [--name Cassandra]

You can repeat the command for additional logs. The agent creates a new log
entry in Logentries under the host specified. It will also enable the file to
be followed by the agent.

Note `--name` is optional to specify log name as it will appear in UI and log
listing. If not specified, plain file name is used.

You need to restart the agent to pick up the new configuration:

	sudo service logentries restart


Follow log files through your configuration file
------------------------------------------------

Apart from server-side configuration you can configure log files to be followed
locally. Locally configured logs use token-based inputs and enables to collect
log entries from multiple sources into one destination log. This can be useful
in an autoscaling environment. You can reuse the same configuration file
multiple times without creating new hosts.

Each log to follow has a separate section in the configuration of the form:

	[name]
	path = /path/to/log/file
	token = MY_TOKEN

Where:

-  *name* is an identifier of the application that is added to your log entries
-  *path* is an absolute path to the file you wish to follow
-  *token* is the token for destination log created in Logentries

Alternatively, instead of `token` specify `destination` parameter in the format
of `host name/log name'. The agent will search for the host and log identified
by their name and retrieve the token automatically. If the host or log does not
exist, it is created.

**Note**: When using the destination parameter it is advised not to initialize multiple agents
with the same configuration file at the same time. This is to prevent a race condition where
duplicate Log Sets may be created. 

Example:

	[name]
	path = /path/to/log/file
	destination = MyHost/MyLog


Using local configuration only
------------------------------

In an auto scaling environment you may not want to create a Host each time you
install the agent.

To disable pulling server-side configuration (and thus avoiding communication
with Logentries API) add this line in the `[Main]` section of the configuration:

	pull-server-side-config=False

Or specify `--pull-server-side-config=False` on the command like for the `init`
or `reinit` commands:

	sudo le reinit --pull-server-side-config=False

By default, locally configured logs are sent to Logentries in Syslog format RFC 5424 which prepends a timestamp and other useful information. If you wish to disable this, you can set the formatter to 'plain' in the `[Main]` section of the configuration.

	formatter = plain


List IP addresses the agent uses
--------------------------------

Run the `ls ips` command to get a list of IP addresses the agent uses. These IP
addresses needs to be whitelisted in firewall.


Follow logs that change their names
--------------------------------------

Due to rollover policies logs are often renamed using a sequential number or
the current timestamp. Luckily the Logentries agent can handle this for you.
The Logentries agent can be pointed at particular folders to gather any active
logs from that directory or its subdirectories using wildcards in file names.
For example, the following patterns can be used with the follow command to
gather logs from the given directories:

	/var/log/mysystem/mylog-*.log

Using wildcards when specifying the log to follow allows for situations where
you need to follow the most recent log in a particular folder. The Logentries
agent looks for any active log in the folder and will monitor the events in
that log.


Manipulate your data in transit
-------------------------------

If you want to modify log entries before they are sent to Logentries, the agent
enabled you to do so via filters. Filters are useful for filtering sensitive
information, obfuscating, or explicit parsing (adding key-value pairs).

Specify a Python module directory in your configuration by adding a line in the form of:

	filters=/opt/le/le_filters

Create empty `__init__.py` to set up a module. Then add filters.py file which
contains filters dictionary. The dictionary informs the agent that for the
given log name, log ID, or token, the specified filtering function should be
used. For example the following dictionary:

	filters={
		"example.log": filter_logname,
		"7e518e54-40e4-4c5a-88df-4559d03126e6": filter_logid,
	}

Where `filter_logname` and `filter_loguuid` are functions which filters events
for the respective log. Filtering functions receive a single string containing
log entries terminated with a new line. Function can modify lines in any way
and return them back for sending to Logentries servers. Do not forget to keep
new line termination. The following skeleton displays typical structure of the
filtering function:

	def filter_example( events):
		# Split the block into individual log entries
		parts = events.split( '\n')[:-1]
		# Collect modified parts
		new_parts = []
		for entry in parts:
			# Do something with entry
			new_entry = entry # XXX
			# Append new entry
			new_parts.append( new_entry)
		# Return modified output
		return ''.join( x+'\n' for x in new_parts)

Typical filtering function is much simpler though. For example the following
filtering function removes all occurrences of credit card numbers:

	import re

	# Credit card number matcher
	CREDIT_CARD = re.compile( r'\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}')
	# Credit card number replacement
	CC_REPLACEMENT = 'xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx'  # '-'.join( ['x'*4]*4) if you prefer

	def filter_credit_card( events):
		return CREDIT_CARD.sub( CC_REPLACEMENT, events)

Filtering file names
--------------------

If you want to explicitly restrict which files can the agent follow, create the
filters module as described in the previous section and define the
`filter_filenames` function. The `filter_filenames` function accepts full path to a
file which is about to be followed. The function returns True if the file name
is acceptable or False otherwise. The agent will ignore files which does not
pass this test. The following example defines filter which allows the agent to
follow log files only:

	def filter_filenames( filename):
		return filename.endswith( '.log')

Alternatively, the following example defines filter which denies to follow any
file outside /var/log/ directory:

	def filter_filenames( filename):
		return filename.startswith( '/var/log/')

Note the examples above do not take into account symbolic links.


System metrics (beta)
---------------------

**Note:** The agent requires [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) library
installed. This library is commonly available from OS repositories named
`python-psutil`.

The agent collects system metrics regarding CPU, memory, network, disk, and
processes. Example configuration may look like this:

	[Main]
	user-key = ...
	agent-key = ...
	metrics-interval = 5s
	metrics-token = ...
	metrics-cpu = system
	metrics-vcpu = core
	metrics-mem = system
	metrics-swap = system
	metrics-net = sum eth0
	metrics-disk = sum sda4 sda5
	metrics-space = /

	[cassandra]
	metrics-process = org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon


Example output may look like this:

Deployment best practices
-------------------------

Logentries agent provides several methods of configuration. The method you
choose depends on the size and structure of your environment. You are free to
combine both methods.

**For small systems** such as single web server, mail server, workstation, the
easiest way is to register the host and logs followed via the agent. The agent
will create a Host entry in the UI and send log entries to this Host for each
followed file. Configuration will be stored on Logentries systems and the agent
will pull the latest configuration during startup.

**For large systems** such as computational clusters, autoscaling setups, the
meaning of particular host is losing its meaning as they are becoming
ephemeral. The best option for these systems is to share the same configuration
across servers in the cluster, using locally defined logs only with
pull-server-side-config set to False. Logs are separated per application.
Applications of the same type (i.e. web, mail, DB) will send data to their own log.
Hosts are distinguished by their hostname which is appended to each log entry.


Linux Agent (LE Agent) Installation
-----------------------------------

There are two ways to install the LE Agent.
